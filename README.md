# ASM_minilibc
Epitech Second Year Project, MiniLibC in ASM, 2019

Subject:

The objective of this project is to create a dynamic ELF library to replace (to a certain extent) the standardC library you use every day on your system.Thanks to themallocproject and the bootstrap, you are now able to replace some functions with your ownimplementations through a dynamic library (which is calledweak binding).
